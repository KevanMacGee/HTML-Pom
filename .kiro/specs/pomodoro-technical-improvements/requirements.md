# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on addressing technical deficiencies and improving the overall code quality, user experience, and maintainability of the HTML Pomodoro Timer. The project is currently functional but has several technical debt issues, code organization problems, and missing modern web development best practices that need to be addressed to make it more robust and maintainable.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Code Organization and Architecture

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining this codebase, I want the code to be well-organized and follow modern JavaScript patterns, so that it's easier to understand, debug, and extend.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the codebase is reviewed THEN the JavaScript SHALL be organized into logical modules or classes
2. WHEN functions are defined THEN they SHALL have clear, single responsibilities and be properly documented
3. WHEN global variables are used THEN they SHALL be minimized and properly scoped
4. WHEN the code is structured THEN it SHALL follow consistent naming conventions and formatting
5. WHEN constants are defined THEN they SHALL be grouped logically and clearly named

### Requirement 2: Error Handling and Resilience

**User Story:** As a user of the Pomodoro timer, I want the application to handle errors gracefully and continue working even when things go wrong, so that my productivity sessions aren't interrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN localStorage operations fail THEN the application SHALL continue to function with default values
2. WHEN audio playback fails THEN the user SHALL be notified but the timer SHALL continue working
3. WHEN invalid settings are entered THEN the application SHALL validate input and show helpful error messages
4. WHEN network issues occur THEN the application SHALL work offline without external dependencies
5. WHEN browser compatibility issues arise THEN the application SHALL degrade gracefully

### Requirement 3: Performance and Resource Management

**User Story:** As a user running the timer on various devices, I want the application to be performant and not consume excessive resources, so that it doesn't slow down my device or drain battery.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the timer is running THEN it SHALL use efficient timing mechanisms without memory leaks
2. WHEN audio files are loaded THEN they SHALL be properly preloaded and cached
3. WHEN the page becomes inactive THEN unnecessary processing SHALL be minimized
4. WHEN DOM updates occur THEN they SHALL be batched and optimized
5. WHEN event listeners are attached THEN they SHALL be properly cleaned up when not needed

### Requirement 4: User Experience and Accessibility

**User Story:** As a user with different abilities and devices, I want the timer to be accessible and provide a smooth experience across all platforms, so that everyone can use it effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using keyboard navigation THEN all interactive elements SHALL be accessible via keyboard
2. WHEN using screen readers THEN the timer state and changes SHALL be properly announced
3. WHEN viewing on mobile devices THEN the interface SHALL be touch-friendly and responsive
4. WHEN the timer state changes THEN visual and audio feedback SHALL be clear and consistent
5. WHEN settings are modified THEN changes SHALL be validated and provide immediate feedback

### Requirement 5: Data Persistence and State Management

**User Story:** As a user who switches between tabs or accidentally closes the browser, I want my timer state to be preserved reliably, so that I don't lose my progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the browser tab becomes inactive THEN the timer state SHALL be accurately maintained
2. WHEN the page is refreshed THEN the current session SHALL be restored correctly
3. WHEN localStorage is unavailable THEN the application SHALL fall back to session storage or memory
4. WHEN timer state is saved THEN it SHALL include all necessary information for accurate restoration
5. WHEN multiple tabs are open THEN timer state SHALL be synchronized or conflicts handled

### Requirement 6: Code Quality and Maintainability

**User Story:** As a developer working on this project, I want the code to follow best practices and be well-tested, so that future changes can be made confidently without breaking existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is written THEN it SHALL follow ESLint rules and consistent formatting
2. WHEN functions are created THEN they SHALL be pure functions where possible and easily testable
3. WHEN bugs are fixed THEN unit tests SHALL be added to prevent regression
4. WHEN new features are added THEN they SHALL include appropriate test coverage
5. WHEN code is refactored THEN existing functionality SHALL remain intact

### Requirement 7: Modern Web Standards and Security

**User Story:** As a user concerned about security and performance, I want the application to follow modern web standards and security best practices, so that my data is safe and the app performs well.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN external resources are loaded THEN they SHALL use secure HTTPS connections
2. WHEN user data is stored THEN it SHALL be properly sanitized and validated
3. WHEN the application loads THEN it SHALL use modern JavaScript features appropriately
4. WHEN CSP headers are implemented THEN they SHALL prevent XSS attacks
5. WHEN the service worker is implemented THEN it SHALL enable offline functionality

### Requirement 8: Audio System Improvements

**User Story:** As a user who relies on audio cues for timer transitions, I want the audio system to be reliable and customizable, so that I never miss important timer events.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN audio files fail to load THEN fallback sounds or visual notifications SHALL be provided
2. WHEN audio permission is required THEN the user SHALL be prompted appropriately
3. WHEN custom sounds are uploaded THEN they SHALL be validated and stored securely
4. WHEN volume controls are provided THEN they SHALL persist across sessions
5. WHEN audio plays THEN it SHALL respect user's system volume and notification settings
