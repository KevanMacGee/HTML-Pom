Deeply analyze this project and find ways it needs to be improved. Don't forget this is a fun project rather than a mission critical app. Look for technical deficiencies. Create a detailed list and plan of how to fix what you find.

Do the tasks look good?

Perfect! I've completed the comprehensive analysis and created a detailed spec for improving your Pomodoro timer project. Here's a summary of what I found and planned:

Key Technical Issues Identified:

- Code Organization: Monolithic 600+ line script.js file with mixed concerns
- Error Handling: Inconsistent localStorage error handling, audio failures not gracefully handled
- Performance: Potential memory leaks, inefficient timing mechanisms, no resource cleanup
- Accessibility: Missing keyboard navigation, no screen reader support, poor mobile experience
- Architecture: Global variables, tightly coupled code, no separation of concerns
- Testing: No automated tests, making changes risky
- Modern Standards: Missing CSP, no offline support, outdated patterns

The Improvement Plan:
I've created a 15-task implementation plan that will transform your fun project into a well-architected, maintainable application while keeping its simplicity. The plan includes:

- Modular Architecture: Breaking the monolith into focused classes (Timer, AudioManager, StorageManager, etc.)

- Robust Error Handling: Graceful fallbacks for storage, audio, and network issues
- Performance Optimizations: Better timing accuracy, resource management, battery optimization
- Accessibility: Full keyboard support, screen reader compatibility, mobile improvements
- Testing: Comprehensive unit and integration tests
- Security: Input sanitization, CSP implementation, XSS prevention

The tasks are designed to be incremental - each builds on the previous ones, so you can implement them one at a time and see immediate improvements. Since this is a fun project built with AI, the plan maintains that spirit while making it technically sound.

You can now start executing these tasks by opening the tasks.md file and clicking "Start task" next to any task item. I'd recommend starting with task 1 to set up the project structure, then working through them sequentially.

Would you like me to help you get started with any specific task?
