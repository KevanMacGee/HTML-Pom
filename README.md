**Version 0.3**

I'm having trouble with the design through AI. I am used to tweaking the CSS by hand but I started this to make something entirely with AI. It doesn't always get what I mean and I'm frequently encountering instances when it would be faster to just write the code myself. So I'm going to accept some "good enough" edits by AI for a while. I'll be concetrating on the functionality for the next few versions, even if it means the design is sub-par for a bit.

* Replaced `setInterval` to avoid time drift.
* Added the ability to remain accurate even if the browser goes inactive.
* Sounds are complete, not rudimentary.
* Added ability to pick the number of Pomodoros.

**To do:**

* Modal styling is basic, not attractive. It need a complete overhaul.
* Needs mobile fine tuning.
* Settings interface layout not final.
