This is a work in progress. I am building a pomodoro timer and only using AI, I'm not hand writing any of the code. (Also, I seem to be working on it for 15 minutes at a time, once or twice a week.)

**Version 0.3**

![Ver 0.2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KevanMacGee/HTML-Pom/refs/heads/main/screenshots/ScreenshotVer0_3.png)

I'm having trouble with the design through AI. I am used to tweaking the CSS by hand but I started this to make something entirely with AI. It doesn't always get what I mean and I'm frequently encountering instances when it would be faster to just write the code myself. So I'm going to accept some "good enough" edits by AI for a while. I'll be concentrating on the functionality for the next few versions, even if it means the design is sub-par for a bit.

* Replaced `setInterval` to avoid time drift.
* Added the ability to remain accurate even if the browser goes inactive.
* Sounds are now complete, not rudimentary. (But I think I am going to redo them again.)
* Added ability to pick the number of Pomodoros.
* Still not satisfied with the settings layout and options.

**To do:**

* Modal styling is basic, not attractive. It needs a complete overhaul.
* Needs mobile fine tuning.
* Settings interface layout not final.

**Version 0.2**
