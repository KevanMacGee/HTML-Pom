I'm having trouble with the design through AI. I used to tweaking the CSS by hand but with I trying to do this all by AI. I'm not going to accept broken or confusing design, but I'm going to let some poor or unbalanced design slide for the next few versions. I will be concetrating on functionality, not form during that time.

* Replaced `setInterval` to avoid time drift.
* Added the ability to remain accurate even if the browser goes inactive.
* Sounds are complete, not rudimentary.
* Added ability to pick the number of Pomodoros.

**To do:**

* Modal styling is basic, not attractive. It need a complete overhaul.
* Needs mobile fine tuning.
* Settings interface layout not final.
